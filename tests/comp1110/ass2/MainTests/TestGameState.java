     * Things to Test:
     *  1. Initialisation of the first GameState
     *  2. That a partial state can be modified with input values
     *  3. That the methods in GameState work as expected, on an empty, partial and full GameState
     *   Specifically, that the following methods work as expected:
     *     - updateTurn()
     *     - updateScore()
     *     - calculateScore()
     *     - calculateAvailableBuildings()
     *     - removeAvailableDuplicates()
